title: "About Me"
---

I'm an AI/ML Engineer with a unique combination of deep technical expertise and a humanitarian perspective shaped by my healthcare background. What drives me is building intelligent systems that democratize AI access rather than concentrating power in the hands of a few corporations.

My journey began in healthcare, where I developed strong empathetic communication skills and a passion for meaningful impact. This experience taught me that technology should serve everyone, not just the wealthy. When I discovered the transformative potential of AI and LLMs right after GPT-3.5's public release, I realized I could create solutions that benefit society at a much larger scale.

Today, I position myself at the forefront of the digital sovereignty movement, particularly within Sweden and the EU. I specialize in self-hosted, local AI solutions that prioritize data privacy, cost efficiency, and independence from foreign tech giants. My extensive project portfolio - from building custom AI servers with Tesla P100 GPUs to implementing sophisticated RAG systems - demonstrates my commitment to practical, production-ready solutions.

What makes me distinctive is my systematic approach to problem-solving combined with infectious enthusiasm for emerging technologies. Whether I'm explaining complex concepts to teammates or diving deep into CUDA optimization, I bring both technical excellence and genuine curiosity to every challenge. My goal is simple: making powerful AI accessible to organizations and individuals who want to maintain control over their digital future.
