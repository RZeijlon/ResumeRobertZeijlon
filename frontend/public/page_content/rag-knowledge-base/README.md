# RAG Knowledge Base Questionnaire

This questionnaire is designed to extract comprehensive professional knowledge about Robert Zeijlon using 2025 RAG best practices. The structure follows **hierarchical chunking strategies** with **semantic-aware organization** for optimal retrieval and context preservation.

## üìä Data Structure Strategy

Based on 2025 RAG research, we're using:
- **Hierarchical Chunking**: Multi-level information organization 
- **Semantic Boundaries**: Questions grouped by meaning and context
- **Context Preservation**: Each section maintains coherent information flow
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Structured data for enhanced retrieval
- **Recursive Organization**: Topics broken down progressively

## üìù Instructions

1. **Answer in detail**: Comprehensive responses improve RAG accuracy
2. **Use specific examples**: Concrete details enhance context
3. **Include metrics**: Numbers and achievements are valuable
4. **Maintain chronology**: Timeline information aids understanding
5. **Cross-reference**: Mention connections between different experiences

## üèóÔ∏è Knowledge Structure

The questionnaire is organized into **semantic clusters** that will become separate RAG documents:

- **Core Professional Identity** (fundamental skills and expertise)
- **Technical Competencies** (specific technologies and methods)  
- **Project Experiences** (detailed work examples with outcomes)
- **Problem-Solving Approaches** (methodologies and thinking patterns)
- **Career Journey** (timeline and growth trajectory)
- **Industry Knowledge** (market awareness and trends)
- **Collaboration & Leadership** (interpersonal and management skills)
- **Personal Philosophy** (values, motivations, and goals)

Each section will be chunked optimally for RAG retrieval while preserving semantic meaning and contextual relationships.
